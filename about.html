        <h2>About ENTITY... </h2>
        <p>ENTITY was created in 2022 by a team of personal trainers with the mission to create a space where people feel comfortable and empowered to change themselves.
         Change for the better, not only growing and building muscle but also working with the mind.
         We have over 100 current members in our community and are looking for more empowered people with a mindset to change and become the best version of themselves.</p> 
         <h3>Are you ready to join our community and grow?</h3>
          <p>We have over 200 different excercise machines in the main gym, 6 personal trainer's and studio's that are made specially for you.
        Our personal trainer's charge a separate fee from membership but we will give you three free 30-minute sessions when you become a member.
        There are three studio's in the gym, a common large studio for anybody to grab a mat excercise and two private soundproof studio's that are available for booking by our members free of charge.
        Our private soundproof studio's feature a DOLBY sound system with an option to connect your own music, blare it and get shredded.
        Upon becoming a member you will get a dedicated introduction to the gym and a chance to communicate and connect with other members.
        Our opening times are 7 days a week, Mon-Sun 7:00AM-23:00PM. We will require a photo identification upon registration and all members must be over the age of 17.
        Check our <a href="membership.html">Membership</a> prices and join now by filling the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> forum.
